Employment
@WalmartLabs 2012 – Present
Principal Product Manager, Mobile Services

Walmart does eCommerce at incredible scale. Mobile Services enabled a dozen mobile applications across four platforms (Android, iPhone, iPad, and mWeb) and three properties (ASDA, Sam's Club, and Walmart). As the Product Manager for Mobile Services, I help create new APIs to orchestrate internal and 3rd party APIs which enable end-to-end mCommerce, including in-store and multi-channel features, which optimize for mobile clients by reducing number of calls and payload sizes, reducing client resources (battery, CPU, bandwidth, etc.), while keeping as much business logic out of the client code as possible. Projects include a Pharmacy make over, Checkout, payment and shipping enhancements, and holiday promotions. My team also has responsibility for Security, Operational Analytics, and Production Support.

Apigee 2011 – 2012
Principal Product Manager, API Tools

Lead cross-product initiatives like Single Sign-On to consolidate eight unique user stores and experiences. Created developer tools such as Console which enable a developer to make an API request in minutes by providing an overview of all the API‘s methods, parameters, default and required values, contextual help, and authentication. Consoles include a social component: allowing developers to share their API requests and responses with other developers and support engineers via Facebook, twitter or in blogs. Applied agile principals to achieve monthly release cycles that allowed for rapid innovation with predictable delivery.
